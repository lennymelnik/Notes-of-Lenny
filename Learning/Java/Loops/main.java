//The for loop has three sections

for (int i = 0/*is run when we enter the loop*/; i <3/*gatekeeper, if it returns true we runt eh statements in the loop, else it exists the loop*/; i++/*increment, runs every time the loop runs*/){


}

//The while sytac is very similar

while (condition){
  //the condition will run for the first time when entering and every time the loop is done. If it returns fase, the loop will not run.
}


//
continue;//will stop the current iteration and move to the next one. But inside a for loop it still runs the third section
